### Welcome! 
This is my first real project published on GitHub, and it’s still under active development.

- No AI or copy-pasted code was used; this project is built from scratch for **educational purposes**.
- The goal is to learn, experiment, and create a personal trading framework.
- Feedback, suggestions, and help are **always welcome**—feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
